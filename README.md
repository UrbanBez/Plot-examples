# Plot examples

Here are listed codes for some plot examples in our manuscript [Stochastic activation and bistability in a Rab GTPase regulatory network](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/776567v1).

Generally, I combine the [seaborn library](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

I recommend saving the plots as vector .svg graphics and editing them in Adobe Illustrator or open-source [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).



In case of any questions, please [email me](mailto:ubezelja@ist.ac.at).





**Note: the figures are not necessary exactly the same as seen in the paper. The examples are meant to present the main formatting features of individual plots.*

## Fig. 3B example
Figure 3B displays a frequency scatter diagram of Rab5 membrane lifetimes before (GDP) and after (GTP) nucleotide exchange. This example will introduce you to displaying scattered data points on a log axis and defining the axis tick values.
